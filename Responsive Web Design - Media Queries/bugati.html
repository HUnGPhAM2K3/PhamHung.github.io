<h2> About the car </h2>
<p>The Bugatti Bolide is a track-only hypercar that was revealed online on October 28, 2020. It is based on the Bugatti Chiron, but with a lighter and more aerodynamic body, and a more powerful engine. The Bolide is designed to showcase the ultimate performance potential of the Bugatti W16 engine, which is said to be the last car ever made with this engine. The name Bolide comes from the French term for “the racing car”</p>
<p>The Bolide has a distinctive design that combines elegance and aggression. The car has a low and wide stance, with a large rear wing and a roof scoop that feeds air to the engine. The body is made of carbon fiber and titanium, and features many aerodynamic elements that optimize the airflow and downforce. The interior is minimalist and focused on functionality, with a digital dashboard and a racing steering wheel. The car also has a safety system that includes a fire extinguisher and an automatic air jack</p>
